# Deploying React apps notes

---

## Deployment Steps

1) Test code - Manually and with automated tests
2) Optimise code - optimise user experience and performance
3) Build App: Run build process to parse, transform and optimise code
4) Upload App: Upload production code to hosting server
5) Configure Server: Ensure app is served securely and as intended

## Lazy loading

- Load code only when its needed

---

- A react SPA is a "Static Website" - only, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  - A static site host is needed
    - Firebase is an example of this

- Need to consider client side routing and server side routing.
