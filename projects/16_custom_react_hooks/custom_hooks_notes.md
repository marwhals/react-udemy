# Custom hooks notes

---

## Working with hooks

1) Only call hooks within component functions or other hook functions
   - React Hooks must not be called outside of React component functions
2) Only call hooks on the top level
   - React Hooks must not be called in nested code statements (e.g inside if-statements)
